## Creating New Prompts

When creating a new specialized prompt:

1. **Name it descriptively**: `{tool}-{purpose}.md` (e.g., `jest-unit-tester.md`)
2. **Include clear sections**:
   - Purpose and when to use
   - Prerequisites and setup
   - Step-by-step methodology
   - Examples and patterns
   - Success criteria
3. **Reference project standards**: Link to relevant docs and config files
4. **Update this README**: Add the new prompt to the list above

## Prompt Invocation from Other Prompts

Prompts can reference each other:

```markdown
For unit testing, see: `.github/copilot-prompts/jest-unit-tester.md`

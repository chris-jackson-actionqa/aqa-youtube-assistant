# Workspace API Documentation

This document describes the Workspace CRUD API endpoints and workspace filtering for project endpoints.

**Related**: Issue #92 - Multi-Workspace Support

## Overview

Workspaces provide isolation and organization for projects. Each workspace can contain multiple projects. The default workspace (id=1) is created automatically and cannot be deleted or renamed.

## Base URL

```
http://localhost:8000/api
```

## Project Endpoints with Workspace Filtering

All project endpoints now support workspace filtering via the `X-Workspace-Id` header.

### Header Usage

**X-Workspace-Id** (optional, integer)
- Specifies which workspace to operate on
- Defaults to `1` (default workspace) if not provided
- Enables workspace isolation for projects

**Examples:**
```bash
# Use default workspace
curl http://localhost:8000/api/projects

# Use specific workspace
curl -H "X-Workspace-Id: 2" http://localhost:8000/api/projects
```

## Workspace Isolation

Projects are isolated by workspace:

1. **Creating projects**: Projects are created in the workspace specified by `X-Workspace-Id`
2. **Listing projects**: Only projects in the specified workspace are returned
3. **Accessing projects**: Cross-workspace access returns `404` (not `403`)
4. **Updating projects**: Can only update projects in the current workspace
5. **Deleting projects**: Can only delete projects in the current workspace

**Security Note**: Cross-workspace access returns `404` instead of `403` to prevent information disclosure about the existence of projects in other workspaces.

---

## Default Workspace

Workspace ID `1` is the default workspace:

- **Created automatically** during database initialization
- **Cannot be deleted** (returns `403`)
- **Cannot be renamed** (returns `403`)
- **Description can be updated**
- **Used by default** when `X-Workspace-Id` header is not provided

---

## Business Rules Summary

### Workspaces
- ✅ Workspace names must be unique
- ✅ Default workspace (id=1) cannot be deleted
- ✅ Default workspace (id=1) cannot be renamed
- ✅ Workspaces with projects cannot be deleted
- ✅ Empty workspaces can be deleted freely

### Projects
- ✅ Projects are filtered by workspace
- ✅ Cross-workspace access returns 404
- ✅ Projects default to workspace_id=1 if header not provided
- ✅ Workspace must exist when creating a project

---

## Example Workflows

### Create a New Workspace and Add Projects

```bash
# 1. Create a workspace
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/workspaces \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Q4 Videos", "description": "Video projects for Q4"}'
# Response: {"id": 2, "name": "Q4 Videos", ...}

# 2. Create projects in the new workspace
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/projects \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Workspace-Id: 2" \
  -d '{"name": "Holiday Special", "description": "Holiday video"}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/projects \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Workspace-Id: 2" \
  -d '{"name": "Year in Review", "description": "Annual recap"}'

# 3. List projects in workspace
curl -H "X-Workspace-Id: 2" http://localhost:8000/api/projects
```

### Switch Between Workspaces

```bash
# View projects in default workspace
curl http://localhost:8000/api/projects

# View projects in another workspace
curl -H "X-Workspace-Id: 2" http://localhost:8000/api/projects
```

### Attempt to Delete Workspace with Projects

```bash
# This will fail with 400 Bad Request
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/api/workspaces/2

# Must delete or move projects first
curl -X DELETE -H "X-Workspace-Id: 2" http://localhost:8000/api/projects/10
curl -X DELETE -H "X-Workspace-Id: 2" http://localhost:8000/api/projects/11

# Now can delete empty workspace
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/api/workspaces/2
```

## Testing

See `backend/unit_tests/test_workspaces_api.py` and `backend/unit_tests/test_projects_api.py` for comprehensive test coverage of all workspace and project endpoints.

**Test Coverage**: 95.90%

---

## Implementation Notes

- Workspace filtering is implemented via FastAPI dependency injection
- The `get_workspace_id()` dependency extracts the header value
- Database queries filter by `workspace_id` column
- Default workspace is created in test fixtures and migrations
- Project count is computed dynamically for workspace responses

---

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements (not in current scope):

- User-based workspace permissions
- Workspace sharing and collaboration
- Workspace templates
- Project move/copy between workspaces
- Workspace archiving
- Workspace-level settings

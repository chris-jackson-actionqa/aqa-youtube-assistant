# Production Backend Configuration
# This file contains production-specific settings for the backend API server.
# The deployment script will copy this to .env in the production directory.

# Database Configuration
# Uses a separate production database to avoid conflicts with development
# NOTE: This configuration uses SQLite which is suitable for single-user desktop deployment.
# SQLite is appropriate for this use case (local desktop app with one user).
# For multi-user server deployments, consider PostgreSQL or MySQL.
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./youtube_assistant_prod.db

# Server Configuration
# Production runs on port 8001 (dev uses 8000)
PORT=8001
HOST=0.0.0.0

# Disable hot-reload in production for better performance
RELOAD=false

# Set appropriate log level for production
LOG_LEVEL=info

# CORS Configuration
# Allow requests from production frontend (port 3001)
# NOTE: Uses localhost because this is a desktop deployment where both frontend and backend
# run on the same machine. For web server deployments, update to your domain.
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3001
